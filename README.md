<h1>Animal Guessing Game</h1>

Welcome to the Animal Guessing Game! 🐾 This Java project was developed as a programming test for an intern Java developer position at one of the companies I applied to. The game utilizes the concept of a binary tree to build an "AI" that can guess the animal the player is thinking of by asking a series of yes/no questions. 🌳🤔

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The core idea behind the Animal Guessing Game is to implement a binary tree structure to create an interactive guessing game. The game starts with a pre-defined binary tree containing one question and two child nodes. The player answers each question with either "yes" or "no," which determines the path the game traverses through the binary tree. When a leaf node is reached, the AI makes its guess. 🎮🐵

If the AI's guess is incorrect, it asks the player to provide the name of the animal they were thinking of and a question that could be asked to help the AI determine that animal in future games. This way, the game learns and improves its guessing abilities over time. 📚🤓


All the game data, including the binary tree structure, animal names, and questions, is stored externally in a text file. The text file is created within the project's hierarchy, and if it doesn't exist, the program creates one. 📁📝

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To get started with the Animal Guessing Game:

 - Clone or download the source code from the GitHub repository. 📥
 - Open the project in your preferred Java IDE. 💻
 - Build and run the application. ▶️

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
The Animal Guessing Game has no external dependencies. It is built entirely in Java, using standard libraries. 🚀☕

<h2>User Interface</h2>
The visual interface of the application is implemented using JOptionPane, a class from the Swing toolkit. This allows for an interactive and user-friendly experience by presenting dialog boxes with messages and options to the player. 😃📲

<h2>Contributing</h2>
This project was developed as a programming test and is meant to serve as a learning resource for beginner Java programmers interested in binary trees. You are encouraged to download the source code, experiment with it, and contribute to its improvement. Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests if you have any ideas or enhancements to share. 🌟🤝
